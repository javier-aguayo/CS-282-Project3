It was a cold, snowy day. This in itself is not so unusual for Minnesota, but
it was the middle of July. A terrible tragedy had taken place only months
earlier and with no sun to break through the dust filled skies, the entire
world was caught in endless, cold, terrible night.

Those who had perished in the catastrophe were the lucky ones. Those left 
behind faced the realization that all thoughts of full stomachs and warm
cozy homes were gone. It was now a brutal world where only the strong and
ruthless survived.
